# AI-Tak-Playing-Bot

Goal: Create a Tak playing bot using adversarial search algorithms (minimax and alpha beta pruning), which arise in sequential, deterministic, adversarial situations.


Description Tak(n): The game of Tak is played between 2 players (black and white) on an nn board with the objective of creating a road, which is a line of your own pieces connecting two
opposite sides of the board. Each square of the board can contain one or more pieces forming a stack,
and each square along the road you build must have a 
atstone or capstone of your color on top. The
5x5 version of the game typically has 21 
atstones and 1 capstone per player. To read the full rules
